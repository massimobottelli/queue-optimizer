#Queue optimizer#
I want to create a program to optimize the two queues of the chairlift for skiers.
The chairlift has an intermediate stop where skiers can board.
If all the chairs are used by skiers boarding at the bottom station, there is no space for skiers who want to board at the middle stop.
So it is necessary to leave some chairs empty to allow skiers at the intermediate stop to board.
The user provides the number of queues (skiers per minute) and the program defines how many chairs should be left empty at the bottom stop; for example, one empty chair for every three chairs to ensure that the two queues are balanced
